# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine everything you I learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works together. 

For this project, I started with the data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). 

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques you have learned.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Examine the data for potential issues.
* Use at least 8 of the cleaning and manipulation methods you have learned on the data.
* Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
* Export a clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.
